  <h2> Brief Biography </h2>
  
  <p>
  I was born September 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1985, in Boston, Massachusetts. Being raised in Boston gave me<br>
  a <strong>thick</strong> Bostonian accent up until my adult years where I began moving around the country.<br>
  I grew up with best friend Matt who for most of my life has had the nickname <em>Burgah Boy</em>.<br>
  <abbr title="Burgah Boy">BB</abbr> and I are still best friends and my experiences with him shaped who I am today.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  From a young age, I was very interested in all things media. When I was 8, <abbr title="Burgah Boy">BB</abbr> and I split our<br>
  cash that we'd saved for over 5 months to buy an <abbr title="Super Nintendo Entertainment System">SNES</abbr>. It was the first video game console<br>
  we'd ever owned, and I've loved video games ever since. When I was 10 I won a local<br>
  Blockbuster Video Game Championship, one of the <strong>greatest achievements</strong> of my life.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  On top of video games, filmmaking and entertainment quickly became my passions. While<br>
  pursuing a communications degree in my early 20s, I found myself making content for <em>YouTube</em>.<br>
  One of my earlier my groundbreaking videos was a short film called <em>H<sub>2</sub>O</em> in which a man is<br>
  trapped in his bathtub for weeks and is forced to take drastic measures to survive. I've since<br>
  gained <s>tens</s> hundreds of thousands of subscribers and continue to grow my channel to this day.
  </p>

  <h2> Career Goals </h2>
  
  <p>
  As mentioned in my biography, filmmaking and entertainment continue to be my passion and I<br>
  plan to keep bringing new content to the world. <em>YouTube</em> has always been an amazing platform<br>
  for sharing my vision, but I plan on moving beyond it for bigger and better projects.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I currently live in Las Vegas, known for its variety of entertainment and the perfect city for<br>
  fulfilling my plans of branching into show business. Eventually, my dream is to have the<br>
  opportunity to create a <strong>full feature film</strong>.
